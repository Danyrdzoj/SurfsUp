# SurfsUp

##Background Challenge

The goal of this analysis is to look over a dataset of weather conditions that has been stored in a SQLite database and provide information that will persuade an investor that opening a Surf n' Shake shop in Oahu, Hawaii is a good business idea. The plan is for the shop to sell surf boards and ice cream all year, but the investor is wary because he previously invested in a similar business that failed due to weather conditions. To entice this investor, we must provide statistical analysis, specifically on the weather conditions in Oahu, that will persuade him that this will be a profitable business venture.

To explore the data in the SQLite database, we used SQLAlchemy to connect and generate queries to retrieve the information we needed for our analysis. We used Jupiter notebook throughout this module to import dependencies and create commands to pull data from the SQLite database.
